# **Dynamic Skill Extraction and Job Description Analysis Using Advanced NLP Models**

## üìã **Overview**
This project focuses on extracting key technical and non-technical skills, tools, and qualifications from job descriptions using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. The goal is to build a robust pipeline to analyze job descriptions dynamically, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant keyword extraction while comparing outputs from multiple advanced NLP models.

## üöÄ **Key Features**
- **Keyword Extraction**: Utilized models like **KeyBERT**, **RAKE**, and Hugging Face Transformers to extract skills and technologies from job descriptions.
- **Model Comparison**: Benchmarked outputs from **Falcon-7B**, **MPT-7B**, **GPT-J**, **BLOOM**, and other models for consistency and accuracy.
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Designed task-specific prompts for extracting structured insights such as responsibilities, skills, and qualifications.
- **O*NET Integration**: Integrated the O*NET API to fetch additional job-specific details for enriched keyword extraction.
- **Future Scalability**: Exploring **DeepSeek** and other cutting-edge LLMs to enhance the system's performance and scalability.

## üîß **How It Works**
1. **Input**: The system takes job descriptions as input.
2. **Keyword Extraction**: Implements multiple extraction methods like KeyBERT, RAKE, and pre-trained models.
3. **Classification**: Dynamically classifies job descriptions into technical or non-technical categories.
4. **Model Benchmarking**: Runs the job description against multiple NLP models to analyze and compare results.
5. **Output**: Produces a structured JSON or plain-text output containing core responsibilities, required skills, and qualifications.
